== I'm getting problems with SSL. ==

If you are getting "Exception CURL error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK" or similar, that indicates problem with the remote SSL certificate.

To fix this, you should just pass array(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false) as the $curl_options parameter in OAuthRequester::requestRequestToken. 

== I don't have CURL, what do I do? ==

You need CURL installed to use this library, sorry. There's no workaround.
