## Overview

This package contains a copy of the class from [`Illuminate/Foundation/Console/VendorPublishCommand`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/8.x/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/VendorPublishCommand.php).

**This repository now follows the Lumen framework versioning.** Use the appropriate version of this package for your Lumen application. _eg. Lumen ^8.0 -> LumenVendorPublish ^8.0. etc._

## Installation

```
composer require laravelista/lumen-vendor-publish=^8.0
```

## Usage

To be able to use it you have to add it to your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file:

```
protected $commands = [
    \Laravelista\LumenVendorPublish\VendorPublishCommand::class
];
```
